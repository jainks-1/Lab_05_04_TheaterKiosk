/* As people pass through an entry kiosk at the theater,
they are prompted to enter their age. If they are 21 or
older, they get a paper wristband. Code a logic program
that asks the user to enter their age and then if they are
21 or over displays a message that they get a wristband.
Note that the program does nothing if they are not 21 or overâ€¦
